# Fruits-Classification_Deep-Learning
We have downloaded the Dataset from
Kaggle.com which is ‘fruits360’ and this dataset contains approximately 55,000
fruits high quality images(100*100 pixels) with 81 different types of fruits.

These 81 fruit types becomes our classes. We used keras library to create the
CNN model and perform the computation on dataset as training and validation.

If user give input image of 100*100 size then our model classify the fruit image
from the 81 types of classes. Moreover, we get training and validation accuracy
of more than 90%.
